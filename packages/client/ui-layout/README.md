# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-layout

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Shell plugin: three-column AppFrame (drag handles and concession chain) plus the `ctx.layout` panel-geometry service; it registers into the runtime-owned `root` slot and declares `sidebar`, `conversation`, `details`, and `conversation.empty`. The sidebar resize boundary is an invisible hit strip, while the details boundary retains its floating pill; only details shrinks during concession and then auto-closes. A closed sidebar retains a 56px control rail while details closes to zero width. The package also seats the theme presenter: it consumes resolved `ctx.theme` snapshots and projects them onto the document (`html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background). Measuring after palette and token application keeps the rendered background as the single color authority; disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

AppFrame always mounts the conversation and details columns; Session-scoped slots control content availability, not physical widths. The transient layout store starts the sidebar at its default width and details closed, and never reads or writes `localStorage`. `openDetails()` requests made before root attachment are applied once when the store attaches; a later close supersedes a pending open. Blueprint requests opening when its presentation slot registers, independently of projection and context RPC completion. Session hydration and selection preserve panel geometry; explicit close still closes details. Repeated opens preserve a dragged width. The conversation owner share is empty, while the sidebar owner share contains only `collapsed` and `width`; registrants obtain business data from standard hooks and actions from their own inject faces.

The `/client` exports are the plugin body (`apply`/`inject`), `LayoutController`, and the four owner-share interfaces. AppFrame, the panel store, and the concession solver remain package-internal.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Panel geometry is transient** — reload restores defaults, and mounted presentation plugins may request opening. Dragged widths are not persisted across reload or process restart.
- **Concession-chain auto-close derives a zero width without touching the preferred width** — the panel restores itself when the window widens; consumers must not read the stored details width as the rendered truth.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.
